### Working on this multidisciplinary project gave me an insight into gene delivery and strengthened my problem-solving abilities for further research work. More importantly, I learned to apply my knowledge and previous experience to empirical analysis and real-world problems.<br/>
In my sophomore year, I started to focus on diseases besides cancer, like **pulmonary hypertension (PAH)**. We set a team of five undergraduates from different majors and carried out a project for novel chemotherapy for PAH. <br/>
As the team leader, I contributed to addressing several critical issues, including **applying for funding from companies**, **contacting faculty members for guidance**, and **designing technical routes**. Besides, to make progress efficiently, I utilized what I learned in my last project on **caveolae-mediated endocytosis** and applied my knowledge in **traditional Chinese medicine**. Integrating this knowledge, we constructed a gene-drug co-delivery platform and confirmed its efficacy in animals.
