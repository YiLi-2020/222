### prj1 Targeted responsive Au-polydopamine nanocapsules for cancer therapy
• Engineered an Au-PDA core-shell system, with tunable size, via supramolecular template-assisted assembly.
• Characterized the nanocapsules using UV-vis spectroscopy, TEM, and SEM.
• Designed and synthesized an αvβ3-targeting peptide and assembled peptide nanocapsules via Michael addition.

### prj2 Fluorescent poly-benzene-1,4-dithiol (pBDT) microparticle
• Engineered pBDT nanoparticles and microparticles with tunable morphology by using different sovents.
• Observed solvent-independent fluorescence of pBDT and collected its spectrum using CLSM.
• Explored in vitro fluorescence in macrophage.

### prj3 Biodegradable calcium phosphate nanoparticles for inducing cyto-osmotic pressure changes
• Used polyethylenimine as a patterning agent for Ca/P nanoparticles, via a precipitation method.
• Analyzed element compositions of Ca/P nanoparticles using ICP-MS and EDX.
• Studied the nanoparticles’ in vitro release profile via a dynamic flow method to reduce particle accumulation.
