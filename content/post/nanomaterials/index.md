### prj1 Targeted responsive Au-polydopamine nanocapsules for cancer therapy
<br/>• Engineered an Au-PDA core-shell system, with tunable size, via supramolecular template-assisted assembly.
<br/>• Characterized the nanocapsules using UV-vis spectroscopy, TEM, and SEM.
<br/>• Designed and synthesized an αvβ3-targeting peptide and assembled peptide nanocapsules via Michael addition.

### prj2 Fluorescent poly-benzene-1,4-dithiol (pBDT) microparticle
<br/>• Engineered pBDT nanoparticles and microparticles with tunable morphology by using different sovents.
<br/>• Observed solvent-independent fluorescence of pBDT and collected its spectrum using CLSM.
<br/>• Explored in vitro fluorescence in macrophage.

### prj3 Biodegradable calcium phosphate nanoparticles for inducing cyto-osmotic pressure changes
<br/>• Used polyethylenimine as a patterning agent for Ca/P nanoparticles, via a precipitation method.
<br/>• Analyzed element compositions of Ca/P nanoparticles using ICP-MS and EDX.
<br/>• Studied the nanoparticles’ in vitro release profile via a dynamic flow method to reduce particle accumulation.
