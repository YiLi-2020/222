### We focus on improving bioperformance of nanomaterials, including photoacustic& photothermal effect, targeting ability, tumer penertration, expression level of ligand, etc. 

<br/>In this part of work, I was mentored by [Dr Yong Cheng](https://sites.google.com/a/eng.ucsd.edu/jokerst-lab/members/curren), a formar postdoctoral researcher in Jokerst Lab @UCSD.
