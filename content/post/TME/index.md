### So my career began. <br/><br/>
As an undergraduate research assistant, I participated in several research projects on nanoscaled delivery systems for the dual targeting of the **tumor microenvironment (TME)** and **cancer cells**. I spend my freshmen year cooperating with graduate mentors to construct a self-assembled thermosensitive liposome to function as a dual-targeting platform, intending to inhibiting metastasis and angiogenesis.<br/><br/>
The project contained the **synthesis of liposomes**, the **analyses of biosamples**, and **pharmacological reasoning**, through which I gained hands-on experience in **designing carriers**, **setting experiment controls**, and **studying targeting mechanism**.
