I am a graduate student at [Northwestern University] (https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/biomedical/), exploring the intersection of nanotechnology and pharmaceutical science. I am actively contributing to [nanomedicine](#foci) design, and a [co-crystallization strategy](#Highlights) that I implemented are now used for co-delivering cargos that vary in hydrophobicity. Besides covalent chemistry, I engineered yolk-shell structures by [supramolecular interaction] (#foci), aiming at tuning their nanomechanical properties.

Before joining Northwestern, I enjoyed sunny days at [UC San Diego] (https://ne.ucsd.edu/), where I focus on [phenolic-mediated assemblies] (#foci), [FRET-based nanosensors] (#foci), and [functional polypeptide structures] (#foci), under the supervision of [Prof. Jesse Jokerst] (https://jjokerst.eng.ucsd.edu/home). We use these materials to improve photoacoustic imaging contrast, photothermal transduction efficacy, and tumor penetration.

In my spare time, I enjoy building [LEGOs ü§ñ](#slider), practicing [kendo ü•∑](#slider), and playing [piano üéπ](#slider).
