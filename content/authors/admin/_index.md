**Flip Tanedo spends his time thinking about dark matter.**

He grew up in Los Angeles and fell in love with physics after reading *The Physics of Star Trek*. This carried into degrees in mathematics and physics at Stanford, Cambridge, Durham, and a Ph.D at Cornell. After a postdoc at UC Irvine, he is faculty at UC Riverside where he is known for being covered in chalk dust after a long dayâ€™s work.
