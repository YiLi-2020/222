abstract: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the common hereditary k idney disease, resulting from mutations in polycystic kidney disease 1 (PKD1) a nd polycystic kidney disease 2 (PKD2). Clinical data and genetic features of si x Chinese families including ADPKD patients were analyzed via Next generation s equencing (NGS), Sanger sequencing, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe ampl ification. In family A, the proband (115) with polycystic kidney (PK), hyperten sion, left ventricular hypertrophy, and valvular heart disease exhibited a hete rozygous nonsense mutation, c.5086C>T (p.Glnl696Ter), in PKD1 (NM_001009944). I n family B, the proband (113) with PK, polycystic liver (PL), hypertension, hyp ertrophy of the left ventricle and septum, valvular heart disease, chronic kidn ey disease (CKD) stage 5, bilateral renal calculi, and right inguinal hernia ex hibited a heterozygous missense mutation, c.6695T>C (pãƒ»Phe2232Ser), in PKD1. In family C, the proband (III1) with PK, PL, seminal vesicle cyst, hypertension, C KD stage 3, hypertrophy of the left ventricle and septum, and valvular heart di sease harbored a heterozygous nonsense mutation, c.662T>G (p.Leu221Ter), in PKD 2 (NM_000297). In family D, the proband (III3) with PK, hypertension, and CKD s tage 5 harbored a heterozygous missense mutation, c.8311G>A (p.Glu2771Lys), in PKD1. In family E, the proband (III) with PK, PL, hypertension, and CKD stage 5 exhibited a heterozygous deletion mutation, exonl5-22, in PKD1. In family F, th e proband (112) with PK, PL, CKD stage 3, hypertension, thickened interventricu lar septum, and valvular heart disease carried a heterozygous missense mutatio n, c.1649A>G (p.His550Arg), in PKD2. Thus, three novel mutation sites which are responsible for ADPKD were discovered in this study.
