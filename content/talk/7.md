abstract: X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH) is characterized by increased circulating fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) levels caused by PHEX (NM_000444.5) mutations. Renal tubular resorption of phosphate is impaired, resulting in rickets and impaired bone mineralization. By phenotypic-genetic linkage analysis, two PHEX pathogenic mutations were found in two XLH families.
