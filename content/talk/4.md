abstract: Bone metastasis in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a complex and multi-stage process that is a major reason for poor survival of patients. Epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT), a developed program in tumor progression, has been extensively shown to promote tumor metastasis, including bone metastasis, in NSCLC. Nevertheless, how EMT influence bone metastasis remains unknown. In this study, we downloaded two gene expression profiles—an EMT model and a bone metastasis model—to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Thereafter, we performed Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and pathway analysis based on DEGs to gain a better understanding of the potential molecular mechanisms. In addition, we identified sevenup-regulated and 10 down-regulated DEGs, which appeared in both the EMT and bone metastasis model. Subsequently, the protein-protein interaction(PPI) network was constructed to visualize potential interactions. These analyses and candidate genes may provide new evidence for EMT-induced metastasis and could help to identify new predictive biomarkers and therapeutic targets.
