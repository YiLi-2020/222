# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In this work, we applied **supramolecular-template-assisted stratge** to fabricate **nano yolk-shell structures**. The idea is to wrap a **plasmonic core** in a dynamic polyphenol network, and fuse a second **polyphenol shell** on it. After template degradation, polyphenol shell creates a semi-soft cavity to host the core and additional cargos, while provides an highly-active interface to incoporate targeting peptide motifs via covalent interaction. In this design, we integrated plasmonic (metal) and photosensitive (polyphenol) materials in a signle yolk-shell structure. Novolty of this partice includes **tunable nanomechanical properties** for enhanced photoacoustic imaging, photothermal transduction, and deep-tumor penetration.
